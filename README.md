### What is a data lake

- A data lake is a central location that holds large amount of data in its raw format, unmodified state.
- We can store the data in its as it is form and we need to define any structure for that.
- We can run different types of analyticsâ€”from dashboards and visualizations to big data processing, real-time analytics, and machine learning to guide better decisions.

### What is a datawarehouse

- A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. 
- Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. 
- Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.
